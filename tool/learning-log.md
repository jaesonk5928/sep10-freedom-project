## Tool: **Animate.css**

### 03/04/2025:
* [Animate.css](https://animate.style/)
  * I created a separate **file** in my _**IDE**_ to tinker the code with it. (Also copied starter code from `index.html`).
  * I watched this short **tutorial** [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzbBcVRquYA) on **(Animate.css)**.
    * I might _re-watch_ the video in case I forget about a certain topic/element.
  * I followed instructions in [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) and inputed into my _**IDE**_.
