# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **Animate.css**

### 03/04/2025:
* [Animate.css](https://animate.style/)
  * I created a separate **file** in my _**IDE**_ to tinker the code with it. (Also copied starter code from `index.html`).
  * I watched this short **tutorial** [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzbBcVRquYA) on **(Animate.css)**.
    * I might _re-watch_ the video in case I forget about a certain topic/element.
  * I followed instructions in [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) and inputed into my _**IDE**_ to tinker with the animations content. 
  * Can I make images animate the same as **text** (HTML)?
    * Can I amimate my whole website to make it more _modern & interactive_?
    * Will animations make my website glitch out/no work for **some** reason?
  * `@keyframes` -> it is a flexible way to use [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) with your current projects without having to worry about the HTML code.
  * The Aftermath:
    * Tinker more/all the animations in my **IDE**, to be more familar with my tool.
    * Watch more **Animate.css** videos, how to take adavntage of the learning.
