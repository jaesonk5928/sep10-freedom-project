# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **Animate.css**

### 03/04/25:
* [Animate.css](https://animate.style/)
  * I created a separate **file** in my _**IDE**_ to tinker the code with it. (Also copied starter code from `index.html`).
  * I watched this short **tutorial** [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzbBcVRquYA) on **(Animate.css)**.
    * I might _re-watch_ the video in case I forget about a certain topic/element.
  * I followed instructions in [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) and inputed into my _**IDE**_ to tinker with the animations content.
  * Can I make images animate the same as **text** (HTML)?
    * Can I amimate my whole website to make it more _modern & interactive_?
    * Will animations make my website glitch out/no work for **some** reason?
  * `@keyframes` -> it is a flexible way to use [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) with your current projects without having to worry about the HTML code.
  * The Aftermath:
    * Tinker more/all the animations in my **IDE**, to be more familar with my tool.
    * Watch more **Animate.css** videos, how to take adavntage of the learning.

### 3/10/25:
* Today, I watched this simple [animate.css](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYQ0I1mvFDE) video. (12 minutes long)

  * I tinkered with some more animations for **HTML** that _animate.css_ has to offer in my **IDE**.

  * After tinkering, the result is that I made a "box element" move from animations.

    * The challenge for this tinkering is that I forgot to move a "box element" on the center.

      * I found the solution by searching it up and adding `margin-(left/right)auto` and then centered it.

    * Can I implement multiple animations, so that I can have one element havre multiple animations during each `@keyframes`

      * Will doing this feature be hard to do? Will I need help in order to achieve this?

  * `--animate-duration` -> This `CSS` variable makes animations either last shorter or longer (It depends how long) (by seconds).

    * Also, when you do a longer animation, it is much slower to appear. On the other hand, shorter animations tend to come out faster.
  * Next Steps:

    * Try to tinker on a daily basis, maybe one in a while. (Also be more smarter when forgeting something.

    * Next LL, I will read an article, of which `HTML` elements look the best with animations. (+ some bootstrap context for extra detail)

   ### 3/17/25
   * Currently, I am reading an article about [7 reasons](https://bamboolab.eu/blog/development/7-interactive-elements-that-will-help-you-get-users-attention) to use **animations** in your website to make it more interactive
     * The article is very detailed, it helped me learn to use animations more often when creating a website.

     * Last Learning Log, the box element that I made, I added some words in the box, which was then animated to slide in the `center` of the website along with the box. It was very cool to witness the animations.

       * A challenge that I
