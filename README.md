# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Jaeson Kwan**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Business**. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **[animate.css](https://animate.style/)** in order to help me make my website.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Learning about other topics that people share can educate you more about the real world.
* Discovering more technology tools like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and tinkering with it can be helpful for shaping your memory.
* Typing up blog entries and write-ups are useful for checking in what you have learned so far during the school year.
* Helping other people can also help yourself, since they might have the same problem as you. Teamwork is the key for solving problems. 

##### CONS
* Focusing on one small, minor error leads to no time for more important things. So be more productive and spread out the tasks.
* Learning mutiple skills are hard and can be stressful, so the best way to learn all of them is to break it up by learning one by one.
* Having problems that can't be solved is very painful. The solutions are only discovered if you understand the topic and what it is asking for.
* Prioritizing your grades is not the way to learn. Prioritize the learning of the material is more important for a better understanding.
