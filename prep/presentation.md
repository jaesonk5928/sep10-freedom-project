# Presentation Plan

## Hook
Here's is the speech for my presentation:
* Do you guys know Wreck It Ralph: Breaks the Internet? Well, I do, and the invention ideas that I came up with are possible in the near future. Businesses are all about communicating with others with work/projects. This is where the internet comes in to help businesses grow.

## Product
* I will show my website, what inspired me to do my **topic, challenges, grows, glows, etc**. I will also show the components from Bootstrap that I used in my website. Demo the responsiveness, explain what the website is about, etc.

## Process
* I will present my _timeline_ of the creation of my FP website. Day 1, Day 2, and so on and on. Also, explain what my website is about. (Introduction, Part A, Part B, misc..) I will also break down what my 2 future inventions will do during the future. Maybe also displaying my wireframes along with the process of making them. Show code snippets for each indiviudal part (navbar, button with cards, etc.)

## Conclusion
* [Url to Project]
* Takeaways
  * Copying components from Bootstrap is easy, but altering it is difficult to do in your own website. For example, making multiple `cards` is easy by copying/pasting, but adjusting to be in the right position is hard.
  * Being behind is good, because it encourages you to rush, but for me, I went on my own pace for making my own project and it helped. For example, my friend was finshed with his MVP, but I was nowhere close to finishing it. So I worked over the weekend for MVP.

<!-- * ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND END PRESENTATION. -->

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"

Hi, my name is Jaeson Kwan, and did you know that Minecraft during it's **BETA** is only made by one person, Notch? Well, now there are a team of workers who work on it, similar to business. Well, minecraft got sold to microsoft. My website talks about what soft/hardware that people use to make thier businesses successful. The website is only currently responsive to mobile and computers. My ideas for example, the **VRPM** (The Virtual Reality Portal Machine), a machine where a person goes inside a portal (similar to Minecraft) and can do, imagine whatever they want.
