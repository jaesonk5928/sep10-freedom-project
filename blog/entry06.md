### Content:
Before writing this blog, I was making a Freedom Project Website about businesses. I am finished with my MVP, but currently working on **Beyond MVP**. The [order](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp) of making my website _(MVP)_ was:
1. I made a navbar and added business content in my introduction. (with a cool background within my `body` element)
2. After, I added even **MORE** content and including some inspiring quotes from famous people for business.
3. Then, I added both **software** and **hardware** tools currently being used in the `card` component (also with the `button` element) by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
4. Nearing the end, I added an `accordion` component with context about future ideas that was made by me. Along side with adding images, it was attached to the `card` element, that had the software/hardware content.
5. Lastly, I tried to make my website responsive, which worked a bit, but I need more time, because as of writing this **blog**, I'm fixing my website's responsivness.

Here's my website after the planned process: **[click here](https://jaesonk5928.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/#)**!

Also, here is the [codespace](github.com) of my website: **[click here](https://github.com/jaesonk5928/sep10-freedom-project)**!


### Challenges & Takeaways
Some Challenges are:
* Making the responsivness of my website
* Croping the images to all be the same height and width
* Figuring out how to make the button pop out only one row of cards.

Some Takeaways are:
* Copying Bootstrap examples of components are difficult to invert.
* Adding content is higher priority then the design of the website.
* Pushing a least once a day is important.

### EDP (Engineering Design Process)
I am currently on **Step 7** of the Engineering Design Process, **_Improve as needed_**. The website that I made about business is yet not done, as even though I completed the MVP, I chose to go **Beyond MVP**. Improving the responsiveness of my website is first priority, along after fixing any weird bugs, then finally, adding animations to most of my website.

### Skills
Some skills that I improved on during the making of my **FP website** were **Embracing Failure** and **Debugging**.

#### Embracing Failure

When other students were making their websites faster then me, I thought I was behind and helpless. But the project wasn't due next week, so I embraced my failure by catching up with people during the weekend and **LOCKED IN**.

#### Debugging

Errors happen alot during coding. So as expected, I got many errors during the FP website. One error was that I couldn't push my work because there was an error message. It took me a while, but I figured it out. I didn't change my settings in my Github account.
