#### 11/4/2024

## About Business (Context) 
Business is a very intresting topic. Business are used everywhere and many popular companies manage business very wisely. Both Software and Hardware are used and is very helpful in terms of organization in order for them to make profit. The difference between both software and hardware for business is that software is less complex and it doesnt really need much of it to profit. Hardware is basically software but it requires more complex startups are they want to aim for huge profits. So technology in business is used to make profit for the company itself in order ofr it to stand strong. 

## Research
Some resources that I searched for Business is in Google. This website that had [Software and HardWare](https://www.pjmconsult.com/index.php/2006/02/software-vs-hardware.html) was very descriptive. This website talked about the similarities and differences about both software and hardware is being managed in business. It also explains the pros and cons of using both software and hardware. Another website that There is also a site I looked at that mentions innovation ideas to boost [Business](https://www.ursaconsultants.com/blog/the-differences-between-hardware-and-software-businesses). It mentions many ways that business use hardware innovations to manage their businesses in the future. For example, AI is being used more frequently due to its compatibility with its uses. 

## (EDP) PEngineering Design Process
Thee part that I am on now is Researching the Problem. The problem with business is that people utilize no technology in business much. They either cant afford technology or they replace humans in doing the same job. The problem is very common agmonst most businesses. For example, many businesses fail because no money or fail of use for money. Most people somethimes plan first if its benificial for thier own company. They probably dont know how to use it to its fullest potential or they waste money. I think technology should be used more in businesses in order for it to do well. 

## Skills 
Some skills that I worked on are **Being Productive**, **Time Management** and **Searching for Reliable Sources**

#### Being Productive
Being productive is important because it helps you realize doing something important is good for either yourself or others. For example, I do homework instead to playing video games because I know homework is more important then games. If I do homework first, then I can succeed. 

#### Time Management
Whenever that  I do things like **Doing Homework** or **Walking Outside**, I have a watch to see what time is it and limit myself from doing one thing longer then other activities and etc. It's very easy to manage time if you can do it yourself when you get used to it. 

#### Searching for Reliable Sources
Some sources are not reliable because itt can trick you into beliving what they wrote and corrupt you. The only way to check if a source is reliable is if you look at the end of the link. For example, _.com_ isn't really relibale oin terms of sources. A reliable one ends with _.org/.edu/.gov_. So I practiced looking for trustable sources. 

### Next Steps 
Overall, I will make a website about businesses and describe ways that technology helps benifit it to help business succeed in life.
