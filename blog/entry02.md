## About Business
Business is a very intresting topic. Business are used everywhere and many popular companies manage business very wisely. Both Software and Hardware are used and is very helpful in terms of organization in order for them to do good. The difference between both software and hardware for business is that software is less capital and it doesnt really need much of it to profit. Hardware is basically software but it requires more complex startups are they want to aim for huge profits. So technology in business is used to make profit for the company itself. 

## Research
Some resources that I searched for Business is in google. This website that had [Software and HardWare](https://www.pjmconsult.com/index.php/2006/02/software-vs-hardware.html) was very descriptive. This website talked about the similarities and differences about both software and hardware is being managed in business.
