### Current State
During this week, I already presented my Freedom Project and my website that took me a long time to my classmates and other 11/12th SEP students. What I was doing before this blog was written were: (It's in order)

* Presented my own freedom project in-class **_and_** at the SEP Expo
* Visited other students projects (11th and 12th graders)
* Tried to impress the judges, but failed unfortunately. (Worth a shot)

### Takeaways (In Class)
Some takeaways that I thought of, while presenting my own project in class were:
* **Don't be _afraid_ to make mistakes while presenting**. People stutter, can't think fast, speak quietly. That's the type of speech that is normal if your scared or worried.
* **Asking for help is normal**, as people are confused about what to think or say if they stutter. For example, I needed help doing a casual demo during the school year in SEP, so it carried during the presentation that I did in class for my Freedom Project.

### Takeaways (The SEP Expo)
Some takeaways that I came up with during the presentation of my project in the SEP Expo were:
* **Don't over-exaggerate** when a group of people listen in on your project. Do what you can show at your own pace, even if there are mutiple people listening.
* **Have fun during the Expo and Relax**! There are plenty of people that would love to see your project, so relax yourself before preparing what to say. Have fun by visiting other people's projects and give them feedback.

### Sources
The sources that helped me plan during the making of my Freedom Project were my **SEP 10** [notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18mdWDCI8ktPyCgQ663UOBMaWZAajFlkBrc3S75W1gMg/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.6o1f62qg6jz9) and my [presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RXVQhrqxYFhU5WLgF1XUQwhwkYCRDCx-0vEdPaAGNYs/edit) that I presented during class and during the Expo.

### EDP (Engineering Design Process)
The step that I am finally on is **Communicate the Results**. I finished my Freedom Project and my presentation slides. Now, I can show it off to other people, including my SEP classmates and other students from 9th, 11th and 12th grade. I am happy with my final result, and should be proud of myself for making a website without anyone, just me.

### Skills
Some skills that I improved on after finishing my **Freedom Project website & Presentation** are **Communication** and **Attention to Detail**.

#### Communication

Communicating with friends and family is easy, but talking to strangers is very hard. This can be seen in school, where talking to other students that you don't know personally is awkward. I overcame that by getting to know them first by introducing myself to them, then after, they introduce themselves.

#### Attention to Detail

When coding my website, I thought that my grammer was correct, so I left it as it is. But when some words were spelled wrong and/or had a typo by someone noticing it, I had to fix it by re-coding again and again. This was so frustrating, so now I double check to make sure my spelling & grammer are correct.
