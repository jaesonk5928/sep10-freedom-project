## Content: Business  
Businesses uses technology nowdays because it helps them grow efficently in terms of communcation, tasks and organization. Businesses have been operating for over 3000 years, it started in South-Eastern Europe/Asia. Technology has changed business operations, making human production less demanding. While it benefits businesses by simplifying management and productivity. It also has challenges such as high costs and potential human-computer wars. Technology like Ai is useful for brainstorming ideas about what the best path for the future. Ai is already expanding and improving throughout the years, meaning that in the future, businesses will succeed even better!

## More Content but Planning for a Website 
Some ideas that I had in mind was a virtual reality (VR) buddy can help with communication, assist with ideas, and even play chess. It can generate a virtual reality world for businesses, with real people and objects. However, the cost may be high, but advanced technology may make it possible in the future. I brainstormed this idea because I think it would be cool to go into a new world to get a fresh start in that world. 

## Sources
Some sources I read was [this](https://www.herzing.edu/blog/impact-technology-business). This website explains the impact on technology on businesses. It provides examples of some technology like cybersecurity, which protects information of your businesses. Overall, this site is very detailed on ways that tech helps. I like the article. Another source would be [that](https://wheniwork.com/blog/small-business-apps). This site describes all the ways why businesses **NEEDS** technology. They also specifcally talked about [Asana](https://asana.com/). Asana helps people and teams keep track of tasks, manage responsibilities, seeks progress, and communicate in real-time zones. It helps that millions of people use it, even businesses to keep track of things. 

## EDP (Engineering Design Process) 
Im am in **Step 3** of the Engineering Design Process, **_Brainstorming Possible Solutions_**. Previously, some businesses (especially the smaller ones) stuggle to afford the most advanced technology to help their business succeed. This is very common. I have some ideas. They are **VR Buddies**. It helps with difficult tasks like organizing files and helps you type. It can also give **"out of the world ideas"** that humans can't think of. After this step, it will be **Plan the most Promising Solutions**. I don't really know if my ideas work because its expensive to build. So maybe it will work. 

## Skills 
Some skills that I developed are **Growth Mindset** and **Communication**. 

#### Growth Mindset
I expanding my growth mindset by being more patient. I did it by helping others before myself because they needed me; even though I had things to do. I commited to this, which made me realize that waiting on the things that were more important was better for myself and others. I let people ask me the questions and I answered them. This showed how more patient I was before. 

#### Communication
Talking to others is not a problem to me but talking to teachers was pretty scary when I was younger. Everytime I was talking to them, I feel like asking a dumb question about a particuallar subject. I got braver when I got oolder and talking to them isnt really bad anymore. The point of talking to the teachers is they can assist you a lot and help students understand the material. I overcame my fear. 

#### Next Steps
I am very excited to change businesses with the ideas that I have in mind.
