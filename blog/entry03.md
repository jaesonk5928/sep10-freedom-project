## More content but Ideas 
Some ideas that I had in mind was a virtual reality (VR) buddy can help with communication, assist with ideas, and even play chess. It can generate a virtual reality world for businesses, with real people and objects. However, the cost may be high, but advanced technology may make it possible. I brainstormed this idea because I think it would be cool to go into a new world to get a fresh start in that world.
