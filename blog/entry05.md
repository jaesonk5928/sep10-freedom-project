### Content
While writing this blog, I've been learning my tool [animate.css](https://animate.style/) for a while now and learned many things from the website, including (X = numbers):
* `@keyframes` -> This makes it so using animations doesn't interfere with the **HTML** code, rather you code it in **CSS** section. It's all up to preference.
* `class="animate__(anything)"` or `animation: (anything);` -> This is the proper code to animate **HTML/CSS** elements classes. It is cool to watch too/recommended.
* `animate__delay-(X)s` or `--animate-delay: (X)s;` -> This code allows animations to not play for a specific amount of time, then plays the animation after. It's good for elements to no load all at once, rather have something play first.
* `animate__slow(er)/fast(er)` and `--animate-duration: X(s)` -> This property allows animations to animate either slower or faster. It depends how you want it. Also, animation duration makes animation last longer/shorter.
* `animate__(repeat-X)/(infinite)` -> This property allows animations to repeat _x_ amount of times or infinite. This is a very "questionable", as people don't usually like repeating animations.

### More Content
After learning a lot from [animate.css](https://animate.style/), I started being productive and tinkered some of the _animation properties_ that it offered. I even included **Bootstrap** components to animate them. Here is the code that I tinkered with in my _IDE_:
```HTML
<div class="container">
 <div class="row">
  <div class="col-12">
    <p id="1st" class="animate__animated animate__pulse animate__slow animate__repeat-3">LOREM IPSUM TEXT</p>
<div class="container">
 <div class="row">
  <div class="col-12">
    <p id="2nd" class="animate__animated animate__pulse animate__slow animate__repeat-3">LOREM IPSUM TEXT</p>
<div class="container">
 <div class="row">
  <div class="col-12">
    <p id="3rd" class="animate__animated animate__pulse animate__slow animate__repeat-3">LOREM IPSUM TEXT</p> <br>
</div>
 </div>
  </div>
</div>
 </div>
  </div>
</div>
 </div>
  </div>
```
The code snippets being shown shows a "**_tinkered_**" website with a _navbar_ and some paragraph _columns_ that are animated from using my tool [animate.css](https://animate.style/). The end resukt was very cool. I used the `animate__slow`/`animate__repeat-3` property while tinkering for my paragraphs. This shows that I've been learning my tool.

### Sources
While [animate.css](animate.style) has many cool sections to read and tinker, some parts were confusing to me. There comes the resources like [Youtube](youtube.com) videos and **articles**. They are informational to watch and can also learn a thing or two. This "_short_" [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzbBcVRquYA) that I watched was about basic usage of my tool. Another (Kinda outdated) [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYQ0I1mvFDE) that I watched was 12 minutes long and it also talked about how to use animations and even tinkered too. Lastly, an [article](https://bamboolab.eu/blog/development/7-interactive-elements-that-will-help-you-get-users-attention) I read was about why animations go good with websites and fits more in the modern era.

### Skills
Some skills that I improved on are **Communication** and **How to Learn**.

#### Communication
When talking to others for something, It's usaully for a problem in my code or something. Before, asking for help to me is feeling like im stupid. But now, I've improved by asking more questions on how to do this and that. Communicating with others helps you feel more connected to others.

#### How to Learn
Learning stuff on your own is hard, I know. But I've developed that skill by watching videos and reading articles to learn. In **SEP** terms, its call _#LOYO_. It means **_Learn On Your Own_**. For example, in Google, I wanted to read an article about animations in HTML and CSS. So I googled **Animations + Coding**. It worked.
