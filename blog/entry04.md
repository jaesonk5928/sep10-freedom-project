## Final Desicions:
Recently, I've been talking about making a website where it is about how people use technology to help thier businesses grow. I chose business because I want to own oone one day. My website also talks about some of **MY** own ideas for business that might help modern day businesses. I can say one of my ideas. So basically, it's  a Virtual Reality (VR) can help with communication by (like a portable translater) helping traslate other languages that might have traveling involved;  assist with ideas (make ideas that are out of the box and origanal, and even play many games. Currently, I am choosing a tool for my freedom project where it will help my website be more playful.
