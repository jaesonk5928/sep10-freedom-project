## Final Decisions:
Recently, I've been talking about making a website where it is about how people use technology to help thier businesses grow. I chose business because I want to own oone one day. My website also talks about some of **MY** own ideas for business that might help modern day businesses. I can say one of my ideas. So basically, it's  a Virtual Reality (VR) can help with communication by (like a portable translater) helping traslate other languages that might have traveling involved;  assist with ideas (make ideas that are out of the box and origanal, and even play many games. Currently, I am choosing a tool for my freedom project to create a website; where tools can help my website be more interactive/modern. The tool that _I've_ choosen is **[Animate.css](https://animate.style/)**. 

## Tool Tinkering 
After I **chose** [Animate.css](https://animate.style/), I decided to tinker with it. The first thing that I did was to go to my IDE and created a new file named `animate-css-tinkering.html` in my _**sep-10-freedom-project**_ folder. Then I copied the `index.html` code and pasted it back in the new file. In the `HTML`, I tinkered by **copying/paste** some code from thier website and let my `h1` do the animation.
An example whould be:
